# Leetcode-1759-Medium-Math-Sliding-Window
A interesting problem. I followed the hint, using nC2 where n is the length of the continuous substring. There is also a much more elegant sliding window solution. What's funny is, I got the pattern but I forgot how to slide the window, so I missed the better solution. But anyway, using math is still enough to figure out the problem.
